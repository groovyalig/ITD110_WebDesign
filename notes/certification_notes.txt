Chapter 1: Markup Language and Site Dev. Essentials

---Web Site Development Principles---

You Need: knowledge of markup languages, a talent for design, an understanding of business concerns & web development issues (copyright, planning, accesibility, etc.)

---Project Management & The Web Development Cycle:---

 - Create and document an initial Web site plan.
 - Obtain relevant input from stakeholders.
 - Communicate the Web site plan.
 - Consider technical and non-technical concerns.
 - Develop the site.
 - Test for Functionality
 - Get the Site Approved
 - Publish the site.
 - Manage the site.


---Developing Accesible Web Pages:---

 - Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 - Protects civil rights of disabled people; includes mandates for equal employment opportunities, accomodations, etc.
		It's a broad application of accessibility standards to influence commercial and social practices related to persons with disabilities.
		Significant compliance failures are subject to financial penalties. Must make your site handi-accesible!
		The standards are officially known as the U.S. Department of Justice ADA Standards for Accessible Design
		The Justice Department generally punishes only violators who exhibit long-term, wanton disregard for the standards
		 - Ensure that all images have text-based descriptions so that sight-impaired visitors can access sites through screen-reader technology.
		 - Provide text-based alternatives to all non-text content
		 - Provide forms that are easily read by screen-reading technology

 - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) - Developed by the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) which was created by the W3C.
		Provide a universal set of standards promoting accessibility.
		Works with worldwide organizations in 5 main areas: tech, guidelines, tools, education & outreach, and research & development.
		WAI aims to ensure that core technologies used on the Web (HTML, CSS, DOM, etc.) are equally accesible to all users.
		Additional WAI concerns and standards:
		 - User agent accessibility : A user agent is any device used to view a Web page. The most common user agent is a Web browser.
		 - WCAG checklist : A checklist for the accessibility guidelines detailed in the WCAG
		 - Accessibility for developers : The W3C also addresses ways to ensure that development tools can be used by disabled people.

 - Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (2001) - Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Standards.
		Requires Federal agencies provide accommodations for the disabled for all electronic & IT developed, procured, maintained or used by federal agencies
		The chief purpose of Section 508 is to ensure that disabled individuals have a comparable level of access to information
		Section 508 includes the following standards for Web sites:
		 - All non-text elements must have a text-based equivalent.
		 - If using multimedia, all equivalent info must be properly synchronized with the multimedia so that disabled persons are not at a disadvantage.
		 - Info must be equally available in color and without color.
		 - Doc's must be made available without requiring an associated style sheet.
		 - Text descriptions must be made available for all image maps.
		 - Client-side image maps should not be used because they cannot be properly presented to visually impaired users.
		 - If using tables for data, you must identify all row and column headers.
		 - If a table has two or more rows or columns, you must use row and column headers.
		 - Sites that use frames must have titles that easily enable alternative browsers to navigate through each frame.
		 - If necessary, a separate text-only site should be made available to ensure access.
		 - When scripting technology is used to enable a site feature (e.g., a form), a plaintext alternative must be available

---General Web page accessibility considerations---

Addressing visual challenges
 - Text readability — Make sure that fonts used are the correct size.
 - Text support for images — All images must have 'alt' attribute
 - Screen-reader support — All pages and page elements can be rendered by audio screen readers.

Addressing audio challenges
 - Alternative audio support — Make sure that a text-based equivalent is readily available for any audio on your page
 - Alternative speech input — If the site includes the ability for speech input, make sure that an equivalent keyboard entry mechanism is available.
 - Text support for audio elements — Make sure that any audio elements are clearly marked with alternative text so that readers can obtain the information.

Addressing cognitive and technical challenges
 - Page content that flashes, flickers or strobes — May cause problems for those with neurological disorders.
 - Alternative navigation — Navigation aids should be provided to help those with lower cognitive skills.
 - Audio support — Audio transcriptions of text-based content may help users with reading disabilities such as dyslexia.
 - Low-resolution alternatives — Design Web pages so that they do not require large, expensive screen resolutions, or provide low-resolution alternatives.


---Creating and documenting an initial Web site plan---

Before you start coding, you must create a plan for the site (aka. site diagram, story board, etc.)
Your Plan Must Include the Following:
 - A statement on the purpose & intended audience for the site. This statement may evolve over time, but it is important to steer all efforts in the proper direction.
 - A rough outline of the pages needed, including:
	- The default page, also called the home page.
	- Sections of the site
	- An estimate of the technologies required (e.g., databases, CGI, search capability, indexes).


---Wireframing---

The process of developing an outline for a Web presence. Steps in the wireframing process usually include:
 - Determining the purpose and objective of the Web site.
 - Identifying all stakeholders for the site.
 - Outlining the basic steps of the development process.
 - Identifying steps for managing the project.
 - Outlining site navigation.
 - Identifying the technologies that are invoked with each user request.


---Determining the audience and message---

Successful Web sites have a strong, central theme aimed at a distinct audience.

As you determine your audience, consider eliciting input from various parties, including:
 - Customer representatives : organizations often have important customers attend meetings to provide input
 - Suppliers : Make sure your product suppliers are ready for your sales volume
 - Shareholders : May provide input on how the page should look/feel


---Validating design issues---

Consider The Following Design Concepts:
 - Message -  Deliver a coherent message for each page. Distracting/Irrelevant info should be removed or relocated
 - Fonts - Use common fonts so browsers can render them, and ensure they're large enough to read
 - Images - Ensure all images contribute to a page's navigability or its message
 - Color - Take time to consider color combinations so that your pages are as attractive and readable as possible.

As you Validate Design Issues, Consider the Following: 
 - Organizational Design Standards - Make sure that you are following developed rules and advice from your department and others
 - Ethnic Diversity - You may be asked to tailor messages to particular cultures and ethnicities
 - Language Choice - English, Spanish, etc. What is your audience / What does the gov't require
 - Common Color Schemes - Preferences for color combos differ btwn cultures. Remain sensitive to & informed about such preferences.
 - Messages that Appeal to Customers - You may need to alter your message about something if you present it to another culture.


---Obtaining relevant input from stakeholders---

Stakeholders can provide or help determine the following information:
 - The purpose of the Web site.
 - The site's look and feel.
 - The services that the audience requires from the site.
 - Funds available to develop the site.
 - Development timelines. Your team will largely determine how long it will take, but will also have to coord. with other departments in the organization.

Remember:
 - People who will approve your project often have no technical expertise in your field. They're still essential to success.
 - Be prepared to explain non-technical needs to a technical audience. (i.e. presenting sales concerns to the IT dept.)


---Leading discussions---

Consider the following strategies that you can use to effectively take the lead during a meeting: *IM HAM FR*
I - Introductions - introduce ppl and explain their role on the team
M - Monitor time — If meetings are too long, participants may not want to attend again.

H - Handle heated discussions — Changing focus may be especially important 
A - Action items, including timelines — A list will help you communicate your team's progress.
M - Distribute minutes — Meeting notes, or minutes, help all parties see progress & determine which topics were omitted

F - Focus the Discussion — Provide an agenda of meeting topics so participants come prepared and expecting to discuss only relevant issues.
R - Recall Past Business - Make sure that each team builds on past decisions and considers past discussions in a meaningful way.

---Testing the Site---

When testing your Web pages for browser compatibility issues, check the following: *SCHITS*
 - Scripting languages — Make sure that any scripting language you use is supported by the majority of Web browsers.
 - Color support — Your customers' browsers may not render them exactly as you have intended.
 - HTML version — Choose a version of HTML that you know most browsers will support. HTML5 is best bc its backwards compatible.
 - Images — Some Web browsers do not support images at all. Always provide alternative text descriptions for images, and use background images sparingly.
 - Table Rendering— Some browsers may not render the information proportionally, which can distort the way ur info appears. Some don't support them at all.
 - Strictness levels — Older browsers may not be able to render the newer versions of HTML or XHTML well.


---Managing the Site---

*CURRENT*
- Create New Content - Innovation and Fresh Content are essential to keep your site popular
- Update Dead Links
- Remove Old Sites
- Remove Unused Pages
- Ensure Connectivity - Make sure you have enough bandwidth so access is not slow
- New Ideas & Feedback - Stakeholders and customers are sure to provide ideas. Some changes may be subtle, others time consuming
- Troubles Must be Reported - Sometimes you need to contact your ISP and begin a trouble ticket to begin resolving a problem.


---Intellectual Property---

Trade secret	Intellectual property that must remain private for a company to retain viability.
Copyright	The legal ownership of expression by an author.
Trademark	A unique word, phrase or symbol that is claimed or officially registered by an organization with the government.
Licensing	The legally authorized use of another person's or entity's copyrighted intellectual property.
Infringement	Any violation of a copyright or trademark.
Plagiarism	A specific instance of infringement in which an individual or entity claims to have created content that they did not


---Hosting and Web Service Providers---

Configuring your own hosting solution:
 Advantages: You have more control over your services // You have more choices.
 Disadvantages: You must buy/house all necessary hardware & software // Configuring your servers will take time & expertise // 
		You must manage it yourself, including security

Using an Internet Service Provider (ISP):
 Advantages: You do not need to purchase hardware or software // The ISP will configure the server for you.
 Disadvantages: You have fewer choices in the configuration // Provides only basic services (limited CGI and small databases) //
		You are dependent upon the ISP's management and security services

Cloud service providers:
 Advantages: No purchase of hardware/software // Will configure your server & provide completed services for your organization // Will create custom solutions
 Disadvantages: flexible subscription fee depending on resources used //  you are dependent upon its management, security services and uptime reliability.

Types of Service Providers:
 - Co-location - You provide the hardware, and they supply space/bandwidth for your server.
 - Dedicated Hosting - The service provider gives you access to a dedicated server that it owns.
 - Virtual Server - One Web server contains your site and several other sites

ISP vs Cloud Servers:
A cloud service provider is prepared to provide more complete services, including:
 - Software as a Service (SaaS)
 - Backup services and nearly unlimited hard drive space on a pay-as-you go subscription
 - Advanced Web & database connectivity, including the creation of custom CGI applications
 - Enterprise resource planning (ERP) - the ability to automate the planning & operations of your entire organization 
Costs Associated with Cloud Service Providers:
 - Database Connectivity
 - Per-Service Costs
 - Bandwidth
 - Customer Support
 - Security
 - Applicaiton Development

//- CHAPTER 6: HTML FORMS -//

Forms require the use of a Common Gateway Interface (CGI)// can also use Active Server Pages (ASP) and Javascript Server Pages (JSP)
	- these use server-side script whereas the users computer or browser uses client-side script
	- 2 functions of CGI script on servers = 1. receive the data  & 2. process and format the data


--- DIAGRAMMING A CGI SESSION ---

necessary elements : web browser, CGI script, web form, web server (with CGI interpreter)

1. The client sends the request to the web server ; the server sends the form
2. The end user completes the form
3. The end user clicks submit/ uploads the completed form to the web server
4. The web server processes the info with the help of a CGI script and interpreter
5. The web server sends the processed info back to the browser where the end user receives a reply

*When submitting a form it goes to the server as a raw text string *Name=Value pairs*
i.e. Name=Alissa&Email=ali@gmail.com&color=green

FormMail
- created by Matt Wright in 1997
- written in Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language) which allows developers to use a free CGI interpreter
- file name FormMail.pl
- designed to receive info from a web form and send it to ur email
- available for free
- easy to customize with minimal modifications

1. download formMail
2. install Perl on your web server
3. define the formMail variables
4. Give executable permissions to formMail on your server
5. refer to teh formMail script in your web form
6. wait for users to visit, and check your email for results
**USE THE LATEST VERSION OF FORMMAIL WHICH ALLOW ITS USE WITHOUT INVITING SPAMMERS

<form></form> - contains all elements for a form
		
	required attributes:
	* method - specifies which method the browser will use to send form data to a Web server
		* get = form data is appended to the URL for use in a query string. Less secure
		* post = form data is posted to the URL in action attr. (preferred bc it sends more characters) requires more processing
	* action - specifies the name and location of the CGI script used to process the form


<input /> - to create text & check boxes, radio buttons, and submit & reset buttons
	attributes:
	* type - designates the form field type as a text box, radio button, submit, reset, password, or check box
	* name - the name of the memory cell/ "variable"
	* value - the value associated with the 'variable'/memory cell

<select></select> - container tag used to create option select lists
	attributes : name , (id, multiple - allows # of selections, size - how many you see w/o scrolling)
	contains <option></option> element

<textarea></textarea> - creates scrolling text area spaces ; you can enter default text...

VECTOR : graphics that use mathematical coordinates with lines, curves, and shapes to create images and specify colors
	 can be created using various tools including Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Freehand
	 Vector graphics are generally small in file size. Their presentation size can be scaled without losing image quality.

BITMAP : graphics that use small dots (usually thousands) to create images and specify colors. Each dot is mapped to bits 
	 stored in a computer's memory. Bitmaps are also called raster graphics, and they include the JPEG, GIF and PNG formats.
	 Making bitmap images more detailed can create large file sizes (e.g., 20 MB). Removing pixels and compressing files 
	 will decrease file size, but will also reduce image quality.

IMAGE MAPS

An image map is an image that contains clickable regions, sometimes called hot spots. Each hot spot acts as a hyperlink.
You define each hot spot with a set of coordinates (indicating its position on the image) and a URL reference.
Client-side image maps use map code embedded within the HTML page.

CLIENT-SIDE:

<map name="mapname">
<area shape="shape" coords="coordinates" href="url" alt="description"/>
<area shape="shape" coords="coordinates" href="url" alt="description"/>
<area shape="shape" coords="coordinates" href="url" alt="description"/>
</map>

Image transparency makes the image seem like its floating on your background/blends it

*GIF89a and PNG support transparency

-- IMAGE INTERLACING --

a technique that allows an image to progressively display in a browser as it downloads.
This action makes your pages more accessible to users with slower Internet connections.
(standard image formats are read top to bottom, top half loads when page is 50% complete, then bottom at 100%)

An interlaced image is repeatedly scanned from left to right. The first pass will render roughly 13 percent of the entire image.
The second pass delivers 25 percent, and then continues in 25-percent increments until the image renders completely.
During this process, the full image will at first appear fuzzy, but will continuously sharpen.
*You can create an interlaced image by configuring an image file in a graphics-editing application and saving it as a compatible file type.

*GIF 87a & 89a , and PNG support interlacing

------ ANIMATION ------

GIF/PNG Animation
   Programs such as the Alchemy Mindworks GIF Construction Set allow you to incorporate several images into one file.
   *GIF 89a & PNG support animation

Flash Animation
   You can create animation using complex scripts, called macros.
   Flash macros manipulate vector-based graphics to create animated sequence (more sophisticated).
   Flash movies are created using the Adobe Flash CS4 application.
   Animation creation applications are quite expensive.

Microsoft Silverlight
   Silverlight is Microsoft's response to Adobe Flash.
   It is compatible with multiple Web browsers used on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.
   Consists of the Silverlight application for creating Silverlight animations, and the Silverlight plug-in for viewing animations on the Web
   The Silverlight plug-in needs to be launched from an HTML page via JavaScript.
   It is largely designed for online video playback and intense graphical interactivity.

Java Applets
   For the animation to render, the user agent must have a Java interpreter installed.
   Java animations may not render as quickly as Flash or Silverlight movies
   Although the Java development environment and all Java players are freely available

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)
   a W3C-recommended language developed by various vendors
   uses XML to describe graphics and graphical applications
   SVG allows you to create cross-platform animated movies.
   Not all SVG images are animated,but this application is common because SVG offers comprehensive animation support.
   SVG is an open standard. However, it provides similar features in addition to animation, including:
	- compression : high quality movies can be made to have a smaller file size
	- searchable text : text in SVG images can be indexed and searched
	- zooming : you can zoom in on portions of an image w/o losing quality

--- Mobile Device Issues w/ Animation and Plug-Ins ---

*Animation techniques are often proprietary, so your site visitors may need to download a plug-in.
To solve this problem, you can create another version of your site to accommodate visitors without plug-ins.
Creating an alternative site requires more time and resources on your part, but it ensures that your site is available to all users.

*Plug-ins drain system resources.Plugs-ins are required to view certain content because the content will not play on Web browsers without them.
This consideration is especially important for users on mobile devices. Battery life can decrease up to 40% when using a plug-in
HTML5 solves this issue by providing native support for animation, movies and other multimedia without the use of plug-ins.
CSS and JavaScript are used instead.

*Animation may seem useful and interesting, but it is frequently overused. Its often used for entertainment not information.
If they are used to give info, include alt text for users who are interested only in your site's informational content.

*Animated images can limit accessibility. Only older browsers won't render animation/png but be considerate

----Creating and Managing Images------

There are several options you can use to obtain and manage images for use on your Web pages. You can:
 - Create original images using image-creation software.
 - Scan hard-copy images.
 - Use stock photographs.
 - Obtain photos from photo-sharing Web sites.
 - Use photo management software to organize, edit and share your images.

Image-creation software applications can often handle a variety of formats, such as GIF, JPEG and PNG.
 *Popular image-creation applications include:
  Adobe Fireworks, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, The GIMP, & Inkscape

Image Layers: a good idea to manipulate individual aspects, but only available w/ PNG

Scanning Images

Pixels : the smallest unit displayed by a computer monitor. Form the building blocks for images

Color Depth : Higher bit values (aka bit depths) result in more intense or realistic colors.
              As the color depth increases, however, so does the file size.
	      8 bits of color info per pixel produces up to 256 bits of color info, and so forth.

Image resolution: A user's monitor resolution determines how large onscreen images will be displayed.
    		  Depends on pixels in height and width of display monitor.
		  Higher resolutions have a greater ppi (pix per in.) thus better quality
		  For printing - measured in dots per in. (dpi) // when scanning or importing an image set resolution to 72dpi

-----Using Stock Photos-----

You can buy the rights to a photo to use in printed material or on a website
photographers file their images with an agency that negotiates licensing fees for the photographer
Stock images are then licensed from the agency

2 Types of Licenses = 
- Royalty-Free license - allows the buyer to use an image without having to pay a royalty each time the image is used.
			 The buyer also does not have the right to resell or transfer the image. Price based on file size.

- Rights-managed license - allows the buyer to "rent" an image through negotiation of a specific price for a specific use.
			   Rights-managed licenses are usually more expensive than royalty-free licenses, but allow for much larger print runs.
			   Generally, the fee charged is based on the scope of the project.


-----Microstock Photography-----

iStockphoto is an online microstock photography provider. Usually charge super cheap prices ($1) to use a photo
They accept professional and amateur photography and deal almost exclusively over the internet
Image prices are based on credits , and credit prices can range.

--------Free Images -------------

Some Web sites offer digital photos for personal and commercial use free of charge, with certain restrictions.

-------Photo Sharing--------------

Another possible source for free images is photo-sharing Web sites, although photographs on these Web sites are copyrighted to the photographer
and you must contact the photographer or owner of the photo to obtain permission to use the images.

Server-Side Languages 

Attributes: code is executed by server not the browser
	    code is placed in files called applications, assigned execute permissions by the server
	    in some cases it is placed in the HTML
	    code executes because an interpreter has been installed and activated on the server

Purposes:   Browser detection, Database Connectivity, Cookie Creation and Identification
	    Logon scripts, Hit counters, & File Uploading and Downloading

Common Languages: PHP, Perl, ASP, Visual Basic, C, C++, C#, and Java


-------PHP Hypertext PreProcessor (PHP)---------

An interpreted server-side scripting language for creating dynamic Web pages.
It is embedded in HTML pages but is usually executed on a Web server.

<?php ...code here... ?> the opening and closing tags


-----Practical Extraction and Reporting Language (Perl)------

A cross-platform language that enables users to write custom CGI programs and system management programs.
Commonly used for various purposes, including Web server processes.

#! = shebang : first line used in Perl apps to point to the location of the Perl interpreter
	       many problems with Perl originate with an improperly written shebang line


-----Active Server Pages (ASP) using VBScript------

Microsoft's original server-side scripting solution. It has largely been supplanted by .NET. PHP is also an alternative.
You can create ASP apps using VBScript, which is similar to JavaScript, except its a proprietary Microsoft language.

<%@ LANGUAGE=vbscript %> - identifies that vbscript will be used
<% ... - the asp vbscript is after this tag

Request.ServerVariables("...") - used to retreive server variables
*variables include... "PATH_INFO", "HTTP_HOST", "REQUEST_METHOD", "HTTP_USER_AGENT", "REMOTE_ADDR", etc.


-------------------------C-------------------------------

A powerful compiled language that has served as the foundation for other languages, inc C++ and Java.
Mostly used to develop stand-alone applications, rather than Web applications.
Procedural = Relies upon subprograms (functions) to accomplish a task in an application.
Uses standard libraries, common to any C implementation, that you can include in the program.

#include <...> = used to include a library so that you can reference that and don't have to write as much code

*ALL C PROGRAMS MUST HAVE A MAIN FUNCTION = int main() {...}


------------------------- C++ ---------------------------

Another compiled programming language.
Object-oriented; not procedural. Can include procedutal elements, but rather than using functions,
C++ will create an object that can be manipulated throughout the program
Benefit to obj-oriented languages = they allow developers to create efficient, powerful code.

Term:		Description:
Object		A discrete portion of an application. Once an object is instantiated (created), it can then be used.
		All objects have specific states and behaviors that can be manipulated. An object is also known as an 
		instance, because an object can be duplicated and then manipulated within a program.

Abstraction	The determination of all elements that make an object unique, separate and distinct from another instance of an object.

Class		A group of similar objects

Polymorphism	The ability of a language to make an obj behave differently or to take on diff characteristics

Inheritance	The ability of one class to share characteristics with another class.

**All C++ programs must be compiled to a specific computer type. Once a C++ program is compiled to a specific type of host,
	it cannot be run on another unless an emulator is used 


------------------------- Java ---------------------------

Also an object-oriented programming language. Java is a compiled language; however,
Java is designed to allow its applications to run on any operating system that has the Java interpreter installed.

2 Benefits: 
  - Java is object-oriented — It allows the creation of powerful applications.
  - Java is platform-independent — You do not compile a Java application to a specific computer type

*Uncompiled text files that contain Java code often have the .java file name extension
  When a file is compiled into a Java application, the file usually has the .jar extension.


------- JavaServer Pages (JSP) & Java servlets ---------

Java can be used to create a JavaServer Pages (JSP) API. JSP is a technology that uses Java commands embedded into HTML code.

Java can be used to create Java servlets. A Java servlet is an application that must be installed directly onto the remote server; 
code from a Java servlet is not downloaded to the browser.
  steps to use Java servlets: compile the servlet, & place it on a server that is capable of handling it

One of the most popular Web servers that supports JSP and servlets is Apache Tomcat


------- Visual Basic (VB) ---------

A compiled programming language developed by Microsoft Corporation.
It's used for stand-alone applications and server-side Web applications.
It is not often used as a client-side application in Web browsers, as is JavaScript or VBScript.

Earler versions were more procedural in nature than obj-oriented
VB now has more obj-or capabilities. Often used in .NET CGI solution
Considered easier than most languages, but as a result can't perform the asks other languages can



------------------- C# ---------------------

a compiled object-oriented programming language, and is the proprietary Microsoft competitor to Java.
C# was designed to be easier to use but still powerful.
Because C# is a Microsoft-specific language, it has features that make it much easier to develop
applications and interfaces for the Windows operating systems.


------------------- Server-Side Includes (SSIs) ---------------------

An instruction within an HTML page that directs the Web server to perform an action
an alternative to CGI because it does not use languages such as JavaScript, Visual Basic or Java.
**instructions are written in SGML
The instruction is used to dynamically add content to a page just before it is downloaded to a user.

Can be used to: 
 - Place the results of a database query into a page.
 - Execute other programs.
 - Indicate the last time that the displayed document was modified.
 - Insert text at the bottom of a page (i.e. the current date/time or a customized message in the footer)
 - Add the current date as a timestamp to a page

FILE NAME EXTENSIONS - 
A Web server that supports SSI reads each HTML page for SSI instructions, and then processes the instructions for each user request.
for HTML files that use SSI to use the .shtml or .shtm file name extension (not just .html or .htm)

SUPPORT IN WEB SERVERS - 
Most Web servers include SSI capability. However, the SSI feature may be disabled.
With Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), you must select features in the GUI to enable SSI.
Even though your Web server may be configured to support SSI, it may not be configured to look for the standard .shtml or .shtm file name extensions. 
  You can... 1. Find the supported extension type for SSI. or 2. Define a MIME type for the .shtml or .shtm extensions for the Web server.

Summary: Here are the server-side scripting languages:

 - PHP: An interpreted server-side scripting language for creating dynamic Web pages
 - Perl: A cross-platform programming language that enables users to write custom CGI programs and system management programs
 - ASP: Microsoft's original server-side scripting solution

Client-Side Languages

Run on the user's computer after the page is downloaded = less processing for server

Issues: some clients don't support JavaScript or other scripting languages
	Users can deactivate script execution in browsers that normally support it (for security purposes)


-------JavaScript-----------

object-based scripting language that allows developers to add interactivity to their Web pages
can be used on the client side or on the server side
When used on the client side, JavaScript code must reside inside HTML documents in order to run.

can add... 
- pop up windows , automatic date/time changes , images and text that change with user interaction, cookie creation and identification

The code is placed within your Web document so that when your browser retrieves a page that incorporates JavaScript,
it runs the programs and performs the appropriate operations.

JavaScript is object-based, not object-oriented because it does not support inheritance / it has a collection of built-in objects, including:
 - Document— allows you to obtain values from and write values to a document.
 - Navigator— allows you to determine the type of browser accessing a Web page.
 - Array— allows you to create a series of variables to later manipulate.

Use <script></script> tags to insert javascript code or link a .js document

Use to detect browser: navigator.userAgent

Practical uses for scripts of this type include:
 - Presenting different versions of a site to different browsers.
 - Informing users in a corporate intranet to upgrade their browsers to a supported version.
 - Ensuring accessibility to disabled users.

You can also use JavaScript to deposit cookies on the system hard drives of users who visit your site. Using simple JavaScript code, you can use cookies to:
 - Store passwords.
 - Store user preferences.
 - Choose which Web pages will be displayed based on the browser version used.

JavaScript can also be used for copyright protection. A simple script can help prevent your Web site from being included in another site without proper recognition.


-------VBScript-----------

can be used on the client side or on the server side, and provides access to built-in documents and methods.
If you use VBScript on the client side, then in most cases Internet Explorer will be the only Web browser that will recognize the code you use.
However, if you use VBScript on the server side, then any browser can use your pages.

Dynamic HTML

An umbrella term to describe HTML's ability to work with other technologies to provide animation, interactivity and dynamic updating in Web pages.
Because it eases the burden on the server, DHTML is an effective front-end and back-end solution.

 - You can use DHTML to control the way in which an image will perform.
 - Automatic adjustment of font sizes and colors - using an event handler
 - Absolute positioning — You can create text that moves to certain positions in reaction to user input.
 - New document content — Content can be exchanged dynamically, without having to refresh the browser window.
 - Granular control over animation, audio and video — Rather than writing page code to constantly present a video clip, 
				you can write code to begin a sequence at a certain time or after a certain event.


-------Document Object Model (DOM)---------

It describes the elements, or objects, within a document rendered by a Web browser.
It is a vendor-neutral, cross-platform Application Programming Interface (API) that specifies how objects in a document 
   can be referred to and manipulated through scripting languages.

Currently, the DOM is not as universal as expected. Most browser vendors either add their own features or do not implement all of the DOM as proposed by the W3C.
To work with the DOM for any browser, you need to use a scripting language

Factors that might affect browser choice include: stability & security / Authentication features / Availability

HTML, the DOM and browser compatibility:
Most HTML elements and attributes are backward-compatible. However, some of the more ambitious improvements, 
  including frames and the ability to respond to users, do not work well (or at all) with earlier browser versions.
Some DHTML solutions will work well in one browser but disable another.
JavaScript appears slightly differently, depending on the browser.

Canvas !!

An HTML API that provides a place on a Web page (a "canvas") where developers can display graphics, animation, 
   video and games "on the fly" without the need for a plug-in.
By itself, canvas is a simple pixel-based drawing API that produces a bitmap image.
You can use the canvas to display simple drawings, animations, graphics or graphs; 
You can also use it for more adv tasks that include interactivity, such as games, simulations, video editing or image configurations.
Allows things to be added/viewed without the need for a Plug-In meaning less resources are used

<canvas>Text Here Will Display if Browser Doesn't Support Canvas</canvas> tags define it
attributes = id, height & width (px) // if omitted the default is 300px high by 150px wide

- it's transparent, but you can add borders, margins, etc to make it visible

Rectangle: 
- fillRect(x, y, width, height) -> draws a filled rectangle
- strokeRect(x, y, width, height) -> draws outline of rectangle
- clearRect(x, y, width, height) -> clears the specified area and makes it fully transparent

Offline Web Application

Allow users to interact with Web sites while they are offline
Web pages will store data locally within the user's browser, utilizing the application cache, allowing them to continue accessing the site.

Utilizing a manifest, which tells the browser which files to store locally, is what allows the user to continue working without the connection.
When the user goes back online, the application cache will automatically update when revisiting the Web site.
The application allows quicker loading of the application next time it is used because it can be run locally
Also reduces load on the server since it only sends out changes/updates made

To set up a site/apps to work offline:
1. create a filename.manifest file (lists the files needed for it to work offline - i.e. the main html, css, js, and images used)
	filename is usually the application name
2. manifest always includes the text "CACHE MANIFEST" in the first line
3. "CACHE:" followed by the files to be included are then placed in the document
4. "FALLBACK:" defines what the user will see in the event a resource does not load
	(i.e. a page that says "Sorry, this page is unavailable", etc)
5. NETWORK includes  an online whitelist of files never stored (need a server to process and would not need/use locally)

in the HTML file that will be using filename.manifest you must include it in the opening <html> tag

Geolocation 

An API that defines an advanced interface for location information associated only with the device hosting the application, such as latitude and longitude.
Geolocation determines how to display a user's location based on how the user visits a Web site
A number of technologies can be used, such as the user's IP address, wireless network, or GPS hardware utilized on his or her device.

How it Works (can use JavaScript - latt/long are returned values)

3 methods:
 - getCurrentPosition() -> Retrieves the current geographic location of the user.
 - watchPosition()	-> Retrieves periodic updates about the current geographic location of the user.
 - clearWatch()		-> Cancels an ongoing watchPosition() call.

Drag and Drop Functionality

Allows a user to move an item from one place on the page to another

When drag-and-drop functionality is enabled on a Web page, all links, text and image elements are draggable. 
With the use of a drop zone — a place where items can be dropped — many elements can be manipulated.

2 kinds: 
 - dragging files from computer onto a webpage
 - dragging items to a diff location within the same page

Steps:
1. specify the html element you would like to be draggable
2. Add an event listener for the 'dragstart' event on any of the HTML draggable elements
3. add an event listener for the 'dragover' and 'drop' events on any elements that will accept a dragged item

JS ->

function allowDrop(ev)
{
   ev.preventDefault();
}

function drag(ev)
{
   ev.dataTransfer.setData("Text",ev.target.id);
}

function drop(ev)
{
   var data=ev.dataTransfer.getData("Text");
   ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));

Web Application Frameworks

A software framework that enables developers to create and manage dynamic Web sites, Web applications and Web services.
Generally provide common programming code for generic functions that can be selectively overridden by the developer for specific functionality.

Can be used to:
 - Help manage the creation and maintenance of online databases.
 - Provide Web page security.
 - Manage data on the servers that host the Web pages.
 - Provide templates that make it possible to change the background of Web pages while keeping the graphics,
	text and other elements of the page intact.


---Building Web Pages w/ Django---

Django is written in Python, which is an open-source, object-oriented programming language.
It allows developers to easily create complex, database-driven Web sites.
Emphasizes Rapid Application Development (RAD) and the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle
	in which the duplication of elements is kept to an absolute minimum.


---Building Web Pages w/ Ruby on Rails---

Another open-source Web application framework that also emphasizes RAD and DRY principle
Works with a wide range of web servers, databases, and operating systems
Emphasizes simplicity and ease-of-use so that developers can create complex web sites quickly

Connecting to a Database

For a database to work you must : 
1. Provide a way for the Web server and database to recognize each other
2. Provide permissions to the database so that it can be read and/or written to


---CGI Permissions---

CGI scripts often fail because the web server does not have execute permissions
1. Web server does not have the permissions to execute files and scripts.
2. The file or script used has incorrect permissions, which prohibits the server from executing the file.

To solve such problems:
1. make sure that the Web server you are using has all of the necessary permissions
2. modify the permissions assigned to the file so that it has only enough permissions to function
	(allowing a file too many permissions can cause serious security problems)


------ISPs and CGI------

Actions you need to request that the ISP perform: 
1. Enable execute permissions on your scripts
2. Create a directory that contains available CGI scripts
3. Provide user names and passwords with enough permissions for the system


-----N-tier applications-----

When discussing databases, three elements are generally involved:
 - Data — the database file or multiple database files.
 - Business logic — the SQL coding necessary to create relationships with the data stored in the database.
 - Presentation — the way that data and business logic are presented on the user screen.


Model: 		Description: 
Single-Tier	All 3 layers are combined into one app/database

Two-Tier	The client is responsible for presentation and business logic
		and server houses only the data. Called a client-server relationship.
		Any change to the database requires client upgrade

N-Tier		All 3 Layers are completely separated. An upgrade in one of the layers
		doesn't necessarily mean the others are affected

//- CHAPTER 9: GUI HTML EDITORS -//

You can create Web pages using a graphical user interface (GUI) HTML editor, also called a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editor. 

2 Types Of GUI Editors: 
 - Page Editors - allow you to create a Web page using your mouse and a toolbar
 - Site Management Editors - provide both Web page creation and site management functionality. 
        They allow teams of designers and developers to work in an integrated environment to design, build and manage Web site and Internet applications.

Features Offered by most GUIs:
 - Explanation: Here are the key features of GUI editor:
 - Templates and Wizards: Allow you to create custom Web pages quickly by selecting from a series of choices
 - Text Style options: Allow you to apply different font styles, alter text size and color, and apply text formats
 - Icon bars: Offer easily identifiable graphic icons to provide the same functions found in text-based menus
 - Images: Allow you to easily insert graphic images into a Web page
 - Hypertext Links: Allow you to create hyperlinks to pages and files within your Web site, and to pages and files on the World Wide Web
 - Import HTML pages: Allow you to open pages from the World Wide Web and save them to a Web site or local file system
 - Table Creation: Allow you to arrange data or organize a page layout
 - Publish Documents: Allow you to click a button to post pages to a Web server

-----GUIDELINES BY W3C TO MAKE SURE GUIs ARE USEABLE FOR PPL WITH DISABILITIES:-----------------------------------------
 1. Make the authoring tool user interface accessible -  tool itself must be accessible to people with disabilities	|
	- must follow applicable accessibility guidelines, such as the ATAG.						|
	- Editing views must be perceivable										|
	- Editing views must be operable, such as providing keyboard access for GUI HTML editors			|
	- Editing views must be understandable, which includes the ability to help authors avoid and correct mistakes	|
 2. Support the production of accessible content									|
	- Fully automatic processes must produce accessible content. 							|
	- Authors must be supported in producing accessible content							|
	- Authors must be supported in improving the accessibility of existing content. 				|
	- Authoring tools must promote and integrate their accessibility features.					|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML TEXT EDITORS 
 ADVANTAGES:
	- handy for learning a scripting language or adding new forms to your site
	- knowing HTML maximizes your use of GUI editors bc you can manually edit code
	- You can learn the fundamentals of HTML and update your pages to the latest version(s)
 DISADVANTAGES: 
	- typing code can be time consuming
	- can be a challenge for people with disabilities
	- not worth it if you only need a page or two

GUI HTML EDITORS
 ADVANTAGES:
	- places code into files for you so creating a site can be simple clicks 
	- can modify code manually
 DISADVANTAGES: 
	- some editors alter or ignore code you enter in manually
	- some are not up to date so they do not recognize newer html tags

*Most GUI editors make it quite easy to:
 - Preview pages in multiple browsers
 - View source code.
 - Validate code using built-in validators or a site

VALIDATION:
Validation engines will read the <!DOCTYPE> declaration first b4 validating the code
 - as a result, the code may fail depending on the declaration and pass with another

When validating the code of a GUI editor consider the following:
 - Most GUI editors include their own native validation tools or offer menus that provide access to validators
 - Some GUI editors have special features that help ensure accessibility in regard to validation

------------------------------------------
----------WEB SITE PUBLISHING:------------
      (Depends On How You Made It)

Most GUI editors have a 'publish' button that makes it easy 
- or - 
You can use a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client
 - FTP is the most common protocol used to transfer files between two computers (or a server & computer) 
 - Requires an FTP client to send and a designation FTP server to receive
 - can also be used to transfer files to an HTTP server, provided that the HTTP server is also running FTP
 - before you can transfer your Web site files, you must decide where your site will be hosted

**PUBLISHING TO A TEST SERVER
Professional Developers Post them to a Test Server before moving them to a production server for the following reasons:
 - To verify that the server can process any CGI and database access requests.
 - To find & fix any dead links 
 - To allow members of the development team and other stakeholders to preview the site.
	(Many changes are likely needed before the final site is ready)

Test Server must be as close to identical to the real server as possible by having: 
 - The same operating system version
 - The same type and version of web server software
 - The sane CGI interpreting software

-------------------------------------------
Developing Pages for Mobile Devices
consider how your site will display on smart devices

Key points for optimizing your site for mobile devices:
 - Keep your pages simple and uncluttered
 - Prioritize your content
 - Optimize your site to a smaller screen size

 - use clean valid markup, keep presentation separate from content/links -or make them clearly distinct
 - always use the alt attribute for <img> tags
 - label form fields
 - Use heading tags to structure and style the page (h1-h4 only; smaller are hard to see)
 - reduce margins and padding to provide more space
 - provide easy to use navigation options/links
 - ensure the content is easy to read

Upsides: easier navigation and optimized user experience
Downsides: minimalistic design, may need to reorganize page, less advertising space

--------------------------------------------
Mobile Apps vs Mobile Web Sites

*Mobile apps are stand-alone applications that are downloaded from a vendor's software repository onto a mobile device
*Mobile Web sites are usually stripped-down versions of traditional Web sites.

**HTML5, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT ARE BEING USED TO CREATE BOTH!!!

Mobile websites > Apps becasue they're accessible from any mobile device regardless of Operating System/Browser, and don't have to be downloaded
Mobile Apps > Websites bc they're built for specific O.Systems ; languages used to create the apps are optimized for the device, which enables them to run faster

Most companies will use both to broaden their reach/audience (in addition to a tradiditonal website)


Converting a Site for Mobile Users:
Many services are available to convert traditional sites to mobile sites

---------------------------------------------
WORKING WITH WEB 2.0 (2001+)
A common term that refers to the changing trends in the use of World Wide Web technology and Web design
Pre-2001 was Web 1.0

Web 2.0 has also led to the development of Web-based communities and hosted services, such as social networking sites, wiki, etc.

Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ) is a Web 2.0 programming methodology that enables Web applications to interact with users in much the same way
 they do with desktop applications. Ajax allows you to create interactive Web applications using XHTML, CSS, the Document Object Model (DOM), JavaScript
 and XMLHttpRequest.

----
Advantages to using browsers as application delivery platforms:
 - cost reduction
 - flexilibilty
 - scalability

Disadvantages...:
 - connectivity
 - speed
 - lockout
------

Personalizing a Web Page with 3rd Party Applications:
can dramatically increase the functionality and usability of your Web page without the need for you to create the programs yourself.
However, be aware that adding such applications may slow page rendering speeds and can easily be overused.
 *iGoogle Portal (www.igoogleportal.com)
 *Google Gadgets API (https://developers.google.com/gadgets/)

--------
Web Feeds
A data format for delivering Web content that is updated frequently, such as blog entries and news headlines
 *RSS — Currently @ 2.0, RSS is the "original" family of Web feeds. RSS 2.0 has the widest acceptance of any feed format.
 *Atom — Currently @ 1.0, Atom is a p recent development but is more robust and feature-rich than RSS. It's designed solely for the syndication of entire news articles.

Atom vs. RSS
Unlike RSS, Atom provides not only the document's content, but also metadata about the document:
 - What it is called
 - Who created it
 - When it was created
 - Where it is located

---------
Podcasts
A podcast is similar to an RSS feed in that the user can download syndicated audio or video digital-media files
To create a podcast, you can produce your own audio files (e.g., MP3, Ogg Vorbis or WAV files) and publish them online.
You can then index the files so that an RSS reader can subscribe to them.

A podcast differs from other digital formats, such as streaming media, in that the podcast files can be syndicated, 
 subscribed to and downloaded automatically as you add new content.

//- CHAPTER 10: WEB SITE DEV. FOR BUSINESS -//

A business that is just starting up, or one that is changing or expanding its offerings, must perform some key steps:
 - Identify a market need or opportunity.
 - Identify a unique product or service to address that need or opportunity.
 - Define the target market.
 - Gather essential user information to help improve the company's product or ability to market and sell.
 - Establish a brand for the product or service and create a Web site and a social media presence
 - Determine how the business can best communicate with the target market.
 - Establish a brand for the product or service.
 - Determine how to advertise the product or service, including developing a Web site and a social media presence.


-----Branding Concepts:-------------------------------------
 *A brand is a concept or collection of symbols associated with a product, service or person

Following are some branding concepts to consider when deciding on a brand...The brand should:
 - Be simple — People remember simple
 - Be different —  You'll stand out if your're different
 - Be safe — Don't offend anyone, esp. your target market
 - Make a promise — Express the benefits of the product or service
 - Reflect the company's attributes — The brand needs to describe what the customer will experience
 - Reflect the company's personality — The brand needs to reflect the way the customer will feel when they purchase that business's product or service
 - Appeal to the intended audience — A brand is often chosen because it helps customers self-identify and decide to purchase a particular product or service.


As you review resources, use the following questions to help determine whether the site is reputable:
 - Has it been updated or issued recently?
 - Is it created by recognized experts?
 - Does the resource tend to push one product over all others?


Keep it simple!
Oftentimes users just scan the webpage rather than fully reading it.
- highlighted keywords
- meaninful headings and subheadings
- bulleted lists 
- use crisp, concise text
- include one idea per paragraph
- include search engine keywords in the main portions of text
- Convey the central message using the inverted-pyramid writing style (i.e., conclusion @ the top, then supporting information).

*a website that is simple to use will keep people coming back
*always have a navigation bar on every page and multiple ways to get back to the home page


-----E Commerce Considerations:----------------------------

3 major e-commerce models that are widely implemented: 
Business-to-consumer (B2C) — A Web-based business sells to consumers or end users.
Business-to-business (B2B) — A Web-based business sells to other businesses.
Consumer-to-consumer (C2C) — Individual consumers sell to other consumers.


-----Marketing & Search Engine Optimization-----------------
Term:			Description:
 - Branding 		Creation of a distinct identity that makes users remember & want to use your product
 - Target Market	The specific sector in a market (i.e., the audience) that a product or service addresses.
 - Demographics		The study of groups of people
 - Niche		A smaller, specialized portion of the market
 - Mind Share		The effect of marketing efforts influencing a particular target market or demographic
 			   (commercial phrases, catch words and sound bites that provoke recognition)
 - Target Date		The projected point in time when a product or service will be released
 - Aggregator		A business (usually Web-based) that markets and sells goods and services that it does not own or store
			   Lets other businesses sell on its site and takes a percentage of the profits

Internet marketing consists of the following practices:
 - Search engine optimization (SEO) — the use of specific techniques to increase a page's or site's rank on a search engine
 - Pay per click (PPC) — You pay your site hosts only when your ads are clicked by the user. Paying for a higher ranking.
 - Web analytics — The practice of collecting data and studying user behavior in an attempt to increase market share and sales.
	- On-Site Analytics: studying visitor behavior once that visitor has accessed your site
	- Off-Site Analytics: determining your potential audience and how well your site has addressed and penetrated a specific market

Pay Per Click Features:
 - Price per keyword 		Make sure you compare prices carefully.
 - Keyword generation service 	How does the service help you generate keywords? An engine, wizard or other interface?
 - Bidding options 		Many sites will prompt you to bid for keywords. Other sites will have fixed prices.
 - Interface quality		Ease of use is vital, because you may waste time trying to learn a difficult interface.
 - Account fee			Many sites require a fee to open an account.
 - Monthly minimum		Some services will charge you if you do not generate a minimum number of keyword hits per month.
 - Software download		Most sites are Web-based. But some services require you to install a software application.
 - Additional features		Write down additional features that will help your situation. These might mean the diff between success and failure
 - Promotions			Many PPC services have promotions that might save you money. Just make sure they dont cost you more money in the long run.

-------------------------------------------------------------

---E-Commerce Payment Tech---

Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) — A generic term that describes the ability to transfer funds using computers
Payment gateways — A system, either hardware-based or software-based, that mediates between a merchant and an acquirer 
3-D Secure — An XML-based protocol used by credit card companies to add security to online credit and debit card transactions. Replaced Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) protocol

---Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS)---

Neither SSL nor TLS are transaction methods; rather, methods used to encrypt data transmissions.
Encryption can provide authentication, data confidentiality and data integrity. Many other methods exist, but SSL/TLS = most universally applied.
TLS is quite similar to SSL, but TLS is an open standard that is updated frequently. TLS has rapidly become the accepted standard, often called SSL or SSL/TLS.

---Public Key Infrastrcture (PKI)---

a collection of individuals, networks and computers that together have the ability to authoritatively confirm the identity of a person, host or organization.
PKI makes it possible for two parties that have never met each other to trust each other. Once trust is established, encryption can begin.

2 Elements:
 - Digital certificate — a signed public key that verifies a set of credentials associated with the public key of a certificate authority (CA).
     All SSL/TLS sessions require a valid certificate, which allows unknown parties to authenticate with each other & begin encryption. 
 - Certificate authority (CA) — a trusted 3rd party that verifies the identity of the person or company that has submitted a certification request (CR).
     A CA is an organization that issues digital certificates and helps to ensure the identity of a person, host or process.
     It is more than just a computer that issues digital certificates; a CA is an entire organization.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Working in a Global Env.

You should be aware of the following items:
 - Currency differences — E-commerce sites facilitate business with people in many different countries. Things to caluculate: currency converstion, taxes, and tariffs
 - International shipping — You must consider searches, costs incurred, and delays by customs, and all tariffs.
                            A product you sell legally in one country may be illegal in another or heavily regulated.
 - Language concerns — Consider the language(s) used by the target audience and the characters necessary. Use unicode!!
 - Relationship management — Two important concepts that can help you ensure success are trust-building and customer self-service.
			     Trust is built through quality customer service and frequent contact.
			     Customer self-service includes the ability to track orders, customize orders & choose prodcuts w/o help of a live person.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Databases and Web Pages 

A form allows end users to enter information into a Web page that sends the information to an organization or business.
When an end user clicks OK or Send, the page sends the user's information to a database in which the information can be processed.

---Web Pages and CGI---

A user-input form must contain code that references a Web server.
This code is called a Web server application. It helps convey the info. provided by the end user to the Web server/database server that can store/process the info.
Such applications are called Common Gateway Interface (CGI) applications because they enable information to pass in and out of a server.

CGI Technology		Description
 - Perl			A traditional CGI technology that is platform-independent.
 - PHP			A newer CGI technology that will run on multiple platforms.
 - ASP			Older; avail only on microsoft or systems with a special interpreter. Can create ASP scripts using Javascript or VBscript
 - .NET			Microsoft's standard dev. platform. It allows you to use various languages, inc. C# (replaced Java), JavaScript, VBScript or Visual Basic.
 - JSP			A universal CGI technology that uses the Java interpreter, allowing developers to create CGI using the Java language.
 - ColdFusion		A proprietary CGI technology designed to be easier to install and use than other interpreters and languages.
 - Python		An open-source CGI tech that emphasizes readability by employing minimalistic code syntax and semantics.  
 - Django 		An open-source Web framework that makes the creation of complex, database-driven Web sites easier by emphasizing the use of components that can be reused.
 - Ajax			A CGI programming methodology that enables Web apps to interact w users in much the same way they do with desktop applications.
 - Ruby			An object-oriented programming language based on Perl and Smalltalk. Has powerful capabilities, but easier to use than many other languages

---Optimizing the Impact of the Web Page---

Search engine companies consider many factors, including but not limited to:
 - How many hyperlinks from other sites point to a page.
 - How informative a page is.
 - How well a page's code is structured.
 - How often the content on the page is updated.

Other relevant considerations include:
 - Using properly validated HTML code.
 - Applying Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
 - Structuring pages correctly.

---Front-End Issues---

A properly created Web page should:
 - Be accessible by all users, including those with disabilities
 - Incorporate attractive images and graphical elements.
 - Contain constantly updated hyperlinks and content.
 - Use tables wisely (not to structure web page)
 - Present carefully designed forms.
 - Securely attach pages to databases.
 - Use the most current technologies appropriate for the page.
 - Use images sparingly. Images can clutter the page and create bandwidth problems.
 - Be easily navigable and without dead ends.
 - Include alternative navigation links. This feature helps accommodate visitors who have deactivated image downloading in their browsers.

Useful Site maps include the following:
 - Topical hierarchy — A site map should clearly outline the site's sections in a visual, hierarchical format.
 - Aptly named site sections — Make sure that each section of your site is named accurately to enable users to find the pages they need.
 - Search capability — Visitors might not find the exact information they seek even after consulting your site map. You can include a search engine text box

---Audience development techniques---

You may be asked for your input regarding ways to develop an audience for your Web site. You might discuss the following methods:
 - Providing standard Web site features, including properly placed video, audio and active content
 - Providing unique Web site features, which include ideas generated by you and your Web team, and input from other areas of the company
 - Using logos and other images traditionally used by the company.
 - Coordinating your efforts with the marketing department to ensure that your Web site's look/feel complements the company's marketing slicks/traditional paper items
 - Tracking user visits, which can indicate the popular parts of your site, and can help you to improve the unpopular parts.
 - Analyzing and interpreting statistics to help increase Web site efficiency.
 - Working with the sales and marketing teams to obtain input from customers about desired Web site features.

*Push Technology - Any technology that automatically provides information to a customer list. (Mailing List)
*Pull Technology - Any technology that provides information to a customer only upon request.
*Visitor Tracking - Any technology that provides the following information: # of visitors to the site/pages, duration of visit, frequency for a specific visitor

---Portals---

A portal is a Web site that acts as a centralized access point for other sites. There are two types of portal: vertical and horizontal.
 - Vertical — a portal dedicated to one specific interest or field
 - Horizontal — a portal that provides links to various Web sites with no particular focus.

---Documenting Changes---

As you make changes to your Web site, make sure that you keep a written record of all changes.
The practice of documenting changes to a site is called change management. 

Documenting change is essential because it allows you to:
 - Remember which changes have been made to the HTML code and/or pages on the site.
 - Ensure that you publish all security updates to the Web server.
 - Provide evidence of good-faith efforts to ensure accessibility.
 - Verify that you have fulfilled requests from departments in your organization.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Back-End Issues
Server resources that process and store user input are referred to as the back end of a Web site.

---Database connectivity---

Databases provide the ability to:
 - Present stored information to customers, and allow them to search and retrieve.
 - Receive information from customers and save it for later retrieval.

There are several database types:
 - Flat file — Information is stored in a single table, often in a simple text file. The Windows registry is an example of a flat-file database.
 - Non-relational — Information is stored statically. Information can be searched, but cannot be reorganized or placed into another database.
 - Relational — Information can be sorted, altered and placed into other databases for retrieval.
 - Object-oriented — A newer form with the capabilities of a relational database, plus greater storage and search efficiency.

Generally, if you want to query a relational database, you use Structured Query Language (SQL).

*You can connect to database files by using the ODBC interface or JDBC.
Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) — ODBC's primary purpose is to allow an operating system to register a database. ODBC supports SQL and all major database vendors. 
				    Once the database is registered, the operating system and its components (such as a Web server) can easily read and update the database. 
                                    ODBC was developed by Microsoft and is proprietary to Windows-based operating systems.
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) — JDBC was developed by Sun Microsystems. Unlike ODBC, JDBC is not limited to Microsoft operating systems.
				    Like ODBC, JDBC supports major vendors, and SQL. JDBC can be run on various systems, including Windows and UNIX.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Bandwidth & Download Time

To download files in a shorter amt of time, you need bandwidth. If you do not have more bandwidth you'll have more download time
*make sure your web pages don't access several large files

Determining Download Time for a Web Page:
Step 1 - Check the size of the HTML file and any associated images, files or programs.
Step 2 - Determine the speed of your network connection, which is generally measured in kilobits per second (Kbps)
Step 3 - The connection speed and the file size must be converted into a common unit of measure for division: either bytes or bits
Step 4 - Divide the file size by the connection speed & that's how long it'll take to download

Remember that the result derived from these four steps is a theoretical measurement. It does not consider certain factors, 
such as the fact that 56-Kbps modems rarely operate above 50 Kbps. Nor does it consider network overhead, noisy phone lines or network congestion. 
Therefore, the best way to determine how quickly users can download your HTML pages is to test them in real-world settings. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Naming Web Page files

Some server administrators prefer that you use the .html file name extension. Others may prefer the .htm extension. 
When in doubt, ask your service provider or Web server administrator which standard you should follow.

Usually, an HTTP server looks for a default page, which is a specially named file. 
The server will present this page automatically each time a user enters the minimum amount of information required to connect to the site.

You can change the name of the default document, but you should be aware that every Web server is preconfigured to a default document name.
Consult the Web server documentation, your site administrator or your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to ensure that your default file name functions properly on your Web server.

---HTTP 404 - File Not Found error---
